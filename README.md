# OpenTok Screensharing with Annotations Sample<br/>Version 1.1.0

The OpenTok Screensharing with Annotations Sample provides functionality you can add to your OpenTok applications that enables users to share their screens between mobile or browser-based devices.

With the OpenTok Screensharing with Annotations sample app, you can:

- Initiate and manage interoperable screensharing with annotation features between two users, regardless of the devices they are using. Both users can annotate the same shared screen.
- Customize the UI features and layout.

You can create mobile apps for Android and iOS, or embed the interactive session between users into any website.

To get started with your development, visit the following sites:

- [OpenTok Screensharing with Annotations Sample for Android](./android)
- [OpenTok Screensharing with Annotations Sample for iOS](./ios)
- [OpenTok Screensharing with Annotations Sample for JavaScript](./JS)

_**NOTE:** The Screensharing with Annotations Sample App requires a **Session ID**, **Token**, and **API Key**. In the samples, you can get these values at the [OpenTok Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.tokbox.com/). For production deployment, you must generate the **Session ID** and **Token** values using one of the [OpenTok Server SDKs](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/server/)._
