# OpenTok Screensharing with Annotations Sample App<br/>Version 200.0

The OpenTok Screensharing with Annotations Sample App provides sample codes you can add to your OpenTok applications that enables users to share their screens between mobile or browser-based devices.

With the OpenTok Screensharing with Annotations sample app, you can:

- Initiate and manage interoperable screensharing with annotation features between two users, regardless of the devices they are using. Both users can annotate the same shared screen.
- Customize the UI features and layout.

To get started with your development, visit the following sites:

- [OpenTok Screensharing with Annotations Sample for Android](./android)
- [OpenTok Screensharing with Annotations Sample for iOS](./ios)
- [OpenTok Screensharing with Annotations Sample for JavaScript](./JS)

_**NOTE:** The Screensharing with Annotations Sample App requires a **Session ID**, **Token**, and **API Key**. In the samples, you can get these values at the [OpenTok Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.tokbox.com/). For production deployment, you must generate the **Session ID** and **Token** values using one of the [OpenTok Server SDKs](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/server/)._
